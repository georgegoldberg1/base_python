# README for Base Python Docker  

Builds ubuntu docker container, installing pip requirements for python and running jupyter notebook in your local browser.

Maps this repo folder into Docker so you can create and save notebooks and then git push outside of docker afterwards.

# Setup:

### Build and start container  
`bash go.sh`

### Stop container 
`docker stop base_python`

### Remove all stopped containers
`docker container rm $(docker ps -aq)`

## Optional:requirements.txt
You can change the packages in requirements.txt
After you run the container, it's recommended to do a pip freeze on the package versions, so this build will hold for future. Python version should be included too ideally.
